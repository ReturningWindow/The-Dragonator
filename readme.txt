The Proof of a Hero for Monster Hunter Rise might be a little late to come out until I find the right version to put in here.

If any bugs appear in the program please report them in the link above again.

Enjoy the program and happy hunting. 

If you want to hunt together add me on discord. I only play GU, and World at the moment. I'll be playing rise when it comes out. I need three other partners.

Disclaimer

I own absolute nothing all of the music belongs to Capcom.
